                <h3>Ship Inspection Game Design</h3>
                <p>
                I was a member of a <strong>team</strong> that developed a Ship Inspection Game for National Maritime Museum in Gdansk. I worked closely with students from the <strong>computer programming</strong> course to develop this game.
                </p>

                <p>
                We started with the game idea and had to compose the interface to match the exhibition in the museum with <strong>colours, style and theme</strong>.
                To make the app <strong>accessible</strong> to more people, there was both Polish and English version of the whole game.
                </p>

                <p>
                We made <strong>wireframes</strong> to create a working concept and prepared 
                <strong>user flows</strong> to see if our design had all the elements needed. We then worked on <strong>various versions</strong> of the design and implemented it into the game before <strong>presenting to the museum staff</strong>.
