                <h1>Hi, I'm Natalia!</h1>
                <p>I'm a <strong>holistic designer</strong>, an <strong>UX generalist</strong> with passion for research and user testing. My background is in industrial and product design, with commercial experience in graphic design too.</p>
                <p>I studied design at Academy of Fine Arts in Gdansk, where I was introduced to the idea of design process and user-centered design by professor Marek Adamczewski. During that time I also attended many workshops and classes focused on information architecture, design thinking or service design.</p>
                <p>I love user research and design where form follows function. To me function is usability and meeting user needs.</p>
                <p>My experience is broad and I'm not afraid of the challenge. I've worked on projects involving razor blades, inland watercrafts, service design, web development and everything in the middle. I believe a good designer can find a way to empathize with the user in any area of expertise.</p>
                <p>I'm happy to help with your next project!</p>
